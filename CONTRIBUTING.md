**Code Format:**

We adopt [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) for arranging and formatting Python code. To streamline the contribution process, we set up a [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/) to format the code under `knowledge_storm/` before committing. To install the pre-commit hook, run:
```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
The hook will automatically format the code before each commit.
