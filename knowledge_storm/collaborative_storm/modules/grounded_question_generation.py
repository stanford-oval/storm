"""
This module handles question generation within the Co-STORM framework, specifically designed to support the Moderator role.

The Moderator generates insightful, thought-provoking questions that introduce new directions into the conversation.
By leveraging uncited or unused snippets of information retrieved during the discussion, the Moderator ensures the conversation remains dynamic and avoids repetitive or overly niche topics.

For more detailed information, refer to Section 3.5 of the Co-STORM paper: https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15232.
